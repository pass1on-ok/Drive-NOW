# Drive NOW

## Description

Drive NOW is a web application for car rentals, including a frontend built with **Angular** and a backend built with **Django**. The system allows users to:

- View available cars for rent.
- Book cars for specific dates.
- Make payments for the rental.
- View the history of their bookings and payments.
- Manage their profile.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **Angular** — for building a Single Page Application (SPA).
  - **TypeScript** — for type-safe development.
  - **Bootstrap** — for responsive UI design.
  - **RxJS** — for handling asynchronous data streams.
  - **HTML, CSS** — for layout and styling.

- **Backend**:
  - **Django** — for building the API using Django REST Framework (DRF).
  - **Python** — the programming language used for the backend.
  - **SQLite/PostgreSQL** — for database management (depending on the configuration).
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** — for user authentication and authorization.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

To get started, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/pass1on-ok/Car-Rental-System.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Car-Rental-System
2. Install and run the frontend
Install dependencies:
Go to the frontend directory:

cd frontend
Install the dependencies:

npm install
Run the frontend:
To start the frontend in development mode, run:

ng serve
The app will be available at http://localhost:4200.

3. Install and run the backend
Install dependencies:
Go to the backend directory:

cd backend
Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the backend:
Run database migrations:


python manage.py migrate
Start the server:


python manage.py runserver
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

4. API Configuration
Your API requests will interact with the following endpoints:

POST /api/bookings/: Create a new booking.

GET /api/bookings/: Get a list of bookings.

POST /api/payments/: Create a new payment.

GET /api/payments/: Get payment details.

POST /api/auth/login/: User login (returns JWT token).

POST /api/auth/register/: User registration.

5. Network Configuration
Ensure that the frontend and backend ports do not conflict. By default, the frontend runs on port 4200, and the backend runs on port 8000. You can change the ports in the configuration if needed.
